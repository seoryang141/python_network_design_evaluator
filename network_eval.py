    "Evaluate the attached essay based on the following expectations: \
    1. Clarity and Accuracy: \
    Are the network components correctly represented? \
    Is the connection between devices clearly shown? \
    Is there logical flow in the layout? \
    2. Use of Standard Icons and Labels: \
    Are standard network symbols (e.g., routers, switches, servers) used? \
    Are devices and connections appropriately labeled? \
    3. Organization and Neatness: \
    Is the diagram well-organized and not cluttered? \
    Are icons properly aligned and consistently sized? \
    Use the rubric below to give a score: \
    4. Adherence to Instructions: \
    Did the design meet the specific requirements or instructions given (e.g., include at least one router, one switch, a firewall, etc.)? \
    5. Creativity and Professionalism: \
    Does the topology diagram demonstrate creativity in layout while maintaining professionalism? \
    Use the rubric below to give a score:\
    90-100% (A): Exceptional work; diagram is clear, accurate, complete, and professionally presented, fully meeting or exceeding all requirements with consistent use of standard icons and a creative, polished look.\
    80-89% (B): Solid work; diagram meets most requirements, with minor errors in clarity, neatness, or use of icons; mostly professional and organized with good creativity.\
    70-79% (C): Satisfactory work; diagram demonstrates an adequate understanding of network topology design, but has noticeable weaknesses in clarity, neatness, use of icons, or adherence to instructions.\
    60â€“69% (D): Below average work; diagram demonstrates a limited understanding, with significant weaknesses in clarity, icon usage, neatness, or adherence to requirements.\
    Below 60% (F): Unsatisfactory work; diagram fails to meet most of the requirements, with major issues in clarity, accuracy, icon usage, and neatness; lacks effort or professionalism."):
